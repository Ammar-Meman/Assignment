  <h1>Delhi</h1>

  <p>
        Delhi, the capital city of India, is a vibrant blend of history and modernity. 
        Known for its rich cultural heritage, Delhi houses iconic landmarks such as 
        the <b>Red Fort</b>, <i>Qutub Minar</i>, and <mark>India Gate</mark>. 
        Walking through its streets is like taking a journey through time, 
        from ancient Mughal architecture to bustling markets.
    </p>

    <p>
        The city is famous for its diverse cuisine — from spicy street foods 
        like <u>chaat</u> and <u>golgappas</u> to world-class fine dining restaurants. 
        Delhi is also a paradise for shoppers, with places like Chandni Chowk, 
        Connaught Place, and Dilli Haat offering everything from traditional handicrafts 
        to modern brands.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond its monuments and markets, Delhi is also the political and 
        cultural heart of India. It hosts major festivals, concerts, and events 
        that attract people from all over the country. Visiting Delhi is not 
        just a trip — it's an experience that captures the essence of India.
