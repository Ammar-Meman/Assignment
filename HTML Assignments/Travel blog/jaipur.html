  <h1>Jaipur</h1>
  <p>
        Jaipur, also known as the <b>Pink City</b>, is the capital of Rajasthan 
        and a treasure trove of royal heritage. Famous for its majestic forts, 
        palaces, and colorful bazaars, Jaipur showcases the grandeur of 
        <i>Rajput architecture</i>. The iconic <mark>Hawa Mahal</mark>, with its 
        beautifully designed windows, stands as a symbol of the city's charm.
    </p>

    <p>
        The city is part of India's famous Golden Triangle tourist circuit, 
        along with Delhi and Agra. Visitors can explore the magnificent 
        Amber Fort, City Palace, and Jantar Mantar â€” a UNESCO World Heritage site. 
        Each monument tells stories of bravery, culture, and the artistic 
        excellence of the Rajput kings.

        Jaipur is also known for its vibrant culture, traditional handicrafts, 
        and delicious Rajasthani cuisine. From savoring <u>dal baati churma</u>

        the city offers an authentic taste of Rajasthan. Visiting Jaipur is 
        truly like stepping back in time while enjoying the warmth of modern hospitality.
