  <h1>Mumbai</h1>
   <p>
        Mumbai, often called the <b>City of Dreams</b>, is the financial and entertainment 
        capital of India. From the iconic <i>Gateway of India</i> to the bustling 
        <mark>Marine Drive</mark>, the city perfectly blends colonial architecture, 
        modern skyscrapers, and vibrant street life. It is also home to Bollywood, 
        making it the heart of Indian cinema.

        The spirit of Mumbai can be felt in its fast-paced lifestyle, 
        diverse neighborhoods, and delicious street food. Famous snacks like 
        <u>vada pav</u>, <u>pav bhaji</u>, and <u>bhel puri</u> are loved by locals 
        and tourists alike. The local trains, often called the lifeline of the city, 
        showcase the true hustle and energy of Mumbaikars.

        Juhu Beach, Sanjay Gandhi National Park, and Elephanta Caves.
