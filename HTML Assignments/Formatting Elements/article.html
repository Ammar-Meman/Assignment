    <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>
        When people talk about computers, they usually imagine screens and keyboards, but the real story starts much earlier. 
        The first “computers” were <b>mechanical tools</b> like the abacus. Later, thinkers such as Charles Babbage introduced 
        the <u>Analytical Engine</u>, which is sometimes called the <strong>first idea of a programmable machine</strong>. 
        Babbage's work wasn't finished in his time, but it inspired generations. 
        Ada Lovelace, often called the <em>first programmer</em>, even wrote notes on how the machine could calculate numbers. 
        These ideas may look simple now, but back then, they were groundbreaking. 
        You could say they were <mark>planting the seeds</mark> of modern technology. 
        History reminds us that progress is often a mix of <del>instant success</del> <ins>slow evolution</ins>.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The journey of computers is usually explained in <b>five generations</b>. 
        The first generation was made up of giant machines that ran on <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>. 
        Then came the use of <i>transistors</i>, which made computers a little smaller and much more reliable. 
        Later, integrated circuits were introduced, and with them, the third generation was born. 
        The fourth generation was powered by <em>microprocessors</em>, which suddenly made it possible for regular people to own personal computers. 
        Now we are in the fifth generation, where <strong>AI (Artificial Intelligence)</strong> and powerful <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> designs are leading the way. 
        Along with the CPU, things like <abbr title="Graphics Processing Unit">GPU</abbr> and <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> 
        shaped how fast and capable a system could be. 
        In short, each generation solved old problems while opening new possibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        Math has always been tied to computing. For example, the famous equation <b>E = mc<sup>2</sup></b> shows how energy and matter are related. 
        Another example is H<sub>2</sub>O, the formula for water, reminding us how <em>symbols carry meaning</em>. 
        Computers also rely on symbols and formulas, turning numbers into logic that powers the digital world.

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
        The Internet we use every day didn't just appear overnight. It started in the 1960s with a project called <b>ARPANET</b>. 
        At first, it was meant for researchers and the military to share information. 
        Over time, it connected more universities and slowly grew. 
        The biggest breakthrough came when Tim Berners-Lee invented the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> in 1989. 
        That invention transformed the Internet into something the whole world could use. 
        Suddenly, information was not limited to labs — it was everywhere. 
        As Berners-Lee himself said:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "The power of the Web is in its universality. 
        Access by everyone regardless of disability is 
        an essential aspect." - <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
        Today, computers are not just machines on desks; they are part of our everyday lives. 
        We moved from <del>dial-up Internet</del> to <ins>broadband</ins> and now even fiber networks. 
        Devices that once needed entire rooms can now fit in <small>our hands as smartphones</small>. 
        The rise of <mark>cloud technology</mark> and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> shows how quickly things can change. 
        At the same time, we should not forget the <em>digital divide</em>, because not everyone has equal access to these tools. 
        Wearable gadgets, smart homes, and even connected cars are all part of this new <u>technology-driven lifestyle</u>. 
        The modern era is both exciting and challenging, reminding us that technology must serve people, not the other way around.

    <h2>Computer Example</h2>
    <p>
        A very small example of how we communicate with computers is through code. Here's a basic HTML snippet:
    </p>

    <pre>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Even using a computer day-to-day involves commands. For instance, if you want to copy something, you press 
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. <br>
        Your system might show a message like: <samp>Text copied successfully.</samp>
    </p>

    <p>
        In programming, placeholders like <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>z</var> are common. 
        These stand-ins let us build <em>flexible formulas</em> that can change depending on input. 
        It's this adaptability that makes coding both challenging and powerful.
